If you have a very strong vent in your kitchen, you may use your stove with a burner set to high. Place a large cast-iron pan or two-burner griddle over the heat and allow it to get hot. At this point you can let the fire die slightly with no ill effect. If using a gas grill or stove, turn heat to medium.","Meanwhile, put the pork on a work surface and, using a meat mallet, pound to an even thickness of approximately 3/4 of an inch.","Combine the garlic, rosemary and 6 tablespoons olive oil in a small bowl, mixing to make a rough paste. Season the pork aggressively on both sides with salt and pepper, then spread half the garlic mixture over one side and half on the other side.","Brush the pan or griddle with the remaining olive oil, allow it to heat until it shimmers and is almost smoking, then place meat on the hot surface and cook, without touching, until it forms a good crust, approximately 10 minutes.","While the meat cooks, surround it with the peaches, cut side down, and dot the fruit with the butter. (If you’re using two cast-iron skillets, place the peaches in their own oiled pan.) Let them cook for approximately 5 minutes, or until they are soft and slightly charred. Transfer to a platter and tent with foil to keep warm.","When the meat is well browned on the first side, use tongs to turn it over, and cook in the remaining butter for another 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the meat to a carving board and allow it to rest below a tent of foil for approximately 5 minutes.

Gently press a few chocolate chips into the tops of the slightly warm cookies (this is for looks and optional, of course!) and finish each with a sprinkle with sea salt. Transfer cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely.","Make ahead tip: Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week. You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Allow to come to room temperature and continue with step 4. Baked cookies freeze well - up to three months.

You can brown the butter for both the blondies AND the icing together. Once it's all browned, set 4 Tablespoons (2 liquid ounces) aside for the icing in step 8. The rest (8 liquid ounces) is for the blondie batter, used in step 6.","Brown the butter: Slice the butter into pieces and place in a light-colored skillet. (Light colored helps you determine when the butter begins browning.) Melt the butter over medium heat, stirring constantly. Once melted, the butter will begin to foam. Keep stirring. After 5-8 minutes, the butter will begin browning and you’ll notice lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan. You will smell a nutty aroma. See photo and video above for a visual. Once browned, immediately remove from heat, pour into a heat-proof bowl, and set aside until ready to use.","Prepare the apples: Meanwhile, return the pan to the stove. (No need to rinse out!) Add the apples, maple syrup/brown sugar, and cinnamon. Stir and cook over medium heat until apples have slightly softened, about 3-5 minutes. Set apples aside.","Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9×13 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the finished blondies out (makes cutting easier!). Set aside.","Make the blondies: Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large bowl.","In a medium bowl, whisk 1 cup browned butter, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until combined. Fold in the apples. Batter will be thick.","Evenly spread batter into prepared pan. Bake for about 35 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick comes out *mostly* clean. Remove from the oven and allow the blondies to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack.","Brown butter icing: Heat the remaining 1/4 cup (4 Tablespoons) of brown butter in the microwave for a few seconds since it has likely solidified by now. Whisk in confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla extract. If needed, add more confectioners' sugar to thicken or more milk to thin out.

(See video tutorial above if you need a visual of kneading dough by hand.)","1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil or nonstick spray.

For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.)","Grease a 9×5 inch loaf pan.","Shape the bread: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. Lightly flour a work surface, your hands, and a rolling pin. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 8×15 inches. It does not have to be perfect– in fact, it will probably be rounded on the edges. That’s ok! Roll it up into an 8 inch log and place in the prepared loaf pan.","2nd Rise: Cover shaped loaf with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow to rise until it’s about 1 inch above the top of the loaf pan, about 1 hour. (See video and photo above for a visual.)","Adjust oven rack to a lower position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). (It’s best to bake the bread towards the bottom of the oven so the top doesn’t burn.)","Bake the bread: Bake for 30-34 minutes or until golden brown on top. If you gently tap on the loaf, it should sound hollow. If you notice the top browning too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil. (I usually add aluminum foil over the loaf around the 20 minute mark.) Remove from the oven and allow bread to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

(Light colored helps you determine when the butter begins browning.) Melt the butter over medium heat, stirring constantly. Once melted, the butter will begin to foam. Keep stirring. After 5-8 minutes, the butter will begin browning-- you'll notice lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan and it will have a nutty aroma. See photo above for a visual. Once browned, immediately remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes.","Meanwhile, whisk the oats, flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together in a medium bowl.","Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside.","Pour the slightly cooled brown butter into a large bowl. Whisk in the granulated sugar and brown sugar until combined. Whisk in the egg yolk and vanilla extract until combined, then whisk in the blotted pumpkin (see note about blotting). Slowly mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until combined. The cookie dough will be thick and sticky.","Using a medium cookie scoop, scoop cookie dough into balls (about 2 heaping Tbsp of dough each) and place 3 inches apart on the cookie sheet. Slightly flatten the balls out-- see picture above-- as the cookies won't spread much unless you help out first!","Bake for 14-15 minutes or until lightly browned and set on the edges.

After roasting I love to drizzle the smallest amount of melted coconut oil on top and then toss them again - this just takes them over the top on the mouth-watering scale and it also rehydrates them after roasting. This recipe can be changed up so many ways too. For a festive twist, try drizzling Pomegranate molasses or Balsamic reduction on top (you can skip the Harissa for a more neutral flavour) and serve with fresh pomegranate arils.

Add the butter, working it in to make a coarse/crumbly mixture. Leave most of the butter in large, pea-sized pieces., Add the sour cream, and stir until the mixture starts to come together in chunks. Turn it out onto a floured work surface, and bring it together with a few quick kneads., Pat the dough into a rough log, and roll it into an 8\" x 10\" rectangle. Dust both sides of the dough with flour, and starting with a shorter end, fold it in three like a business letter., Flip the dough over, give it a 90° turn on your work surface, and roll it again into an 8\" x 10\" rectangle. Fold it in three again., Wrap the dough, and chill for at least 30 minutes before using., To make the filling: If you're using fresh berries, rinse and drain well. Place fresh or frozen berries in a saucepan. Whisk the cornstarch or ClearJel with the sugar, and pour over the berries. Add the salt and lemon juice, stirring to combine., Place the saucepan on a burner set to medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until the small amount of liquid in the bottom of the pan comes to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Transfer the cooked berries to a bowl and let cool to room temperature. It's fine to make the filling ahead of time, and refrigerate until you're ready to use it., Preheat the oven to 425°F; place a rack on the middle shelf. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper., To assemble the pies: Roll the dough into a 14\" x 14\" square. With a straight edge and pastry wheel, or a 3 1/2\" square cutter,  cut out sixteen 3 1/2\" squares., Divide the filling among eight of the squares, using about a heaping tablespoon for each; a slightly heaped tablespoon cookie scoop works well here. Brush some of the beaten egg along the edges of each filled square., Use a knife to cut a vent into each of the remaining eight squares; or use a decorative cutter of your choice., Top each filled square with a vented square, and press along the edges with the tines of a fork to seal., Brush the top of each pie with the remaining beaten egg, and sprinkle with sparkling sugar. Transfer the pies to the prepared baking sheet. Note: If at any time during this process the pies become sticky and hard to work with, simply refrigerate them for about 20 minutes, until firm., Bake the pies for 18 to 20 minutes, until they're a light golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and let cool for 20 minutes before serving., Store pies, lightly wrapped, at room temperature for a couple of days; freeze for longer storage."],"photoIds":["0ad2271db11544b3bab8dc6b3412d603"],"adCampaignId":null,"photoUrls":[],"scaleFactor":null,"rating":null,"creationTimestamp":1593963841.7901912,"nutritionalInfo":"Serving Size: 1 handpie\nCalories: 400\nFat: 27g\nSaturated Fat: 16g\nTrans Fat: 1g\nCholesterol: 90mg\nSodium: 210mg\nCarbohydrates: 38g\nFiber: 2g\nSugar: 12g\nProtein: 5g","cookTime":1200,"prepTime":1800,"servings":"8 hand pies","paprikaIdentifier":null},{"identifier":"532d080e8e644c1db0ef08c2d506e9cd","timestamp":1586574439.15193,"name":"Tomatillo Turkey Chili","icon":null,"note":"This savory chili feeds a crowd and goes great with a wedge of cornbread!","sourceName":"garlicandzest.com","sourceUrl":"https://www.garlicandzest.com/simple-turkey-chili-tomatillos-white-beans/","ingredients":[{"rawIngredient":"1 pound tomatillos (peeled and quartered)","name":"tomatillos (peeled and quartered)","quantity":"1 pound","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (note - do not use the entire can of chilis -- only 1 pepper)","name":"chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (note - do not use the entire can of chilis -- only 1 pepper)","quantity":"1","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"1 teaspoon adobo sauce (from the can of chipotle peppers)","name":"adobo sauce (from the can of chipotle peppers)","quantity":"1 teaspoon","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"2 cups chicken broth (low sodium)","name":"chicken broth (low sodium)","quantity":"2 cups","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"2 tablespoons olive oil","name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tablespoons","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"1 large onion (diced)","name":"onion (diced)","quantity":"1 large","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"2 stalks celery (diced)","name":"celery (diced)","quantity":"2 stalks","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"1/2 sweet bell pepper (seeded and diced)","name":"sweet bell pepper (seeded and diced)","quantity":"1/2","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"1 jalapeño pepper (diced (for more heat- keep seeds and membranes, for less, discard seeds and membranes))","name":"jalapeño pepper (diced (for more heat- keep seeds and membranes, for less, discard seeds and membranes))","quantity":"1","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"3 cloves garlic (minced)","name":"garlic (minced)","quantity":"3 cloves","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"3/4 teaspoon salt","name":"salt","quantity":"3/4 teaspoon","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"2 tablespoons ground cumin","name":"ground cumin","quantity":"2 tablespoons","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"1/2 teaspoon ancho chili powder (or other chili powder)","name":"ancho chili powder (or other chili powder)","quantity":"1/2 teaspoon","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"pinch cayenne pepper (optional)","name":"cayenne pepper (optional)","quantity":"pinch","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"2 teaspoons dried oregano","name":"dried oregano","quantity":"2 teaspoons","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"3 pounds ground turkey (I use one pound extra lean and one pound regular)","name":"ground turkey (I use one pound extra lean and one pound regular)","quantity":"3 pounds","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"1 bay leaf","name":"bay leaf","quantity":"1","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"1 cup fire roasted hatch chiles (skins, stems and seeds removed)","name":"fire roasted hatch chiles (skins, stems and seeds removed)","quantity":"1 cup","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"2 15-ounce cans cannellini beans (rinsed and drained)","name":"cannellini beans (rinsed and drained)","quantity":"2 15-ounce cans","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"1 tablespoon corn meal","name":"corn meal","quantity":"1 tablespoon","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"1/2 cup cilantro (chopped, + more for garnish)","name":"cilantro (chopped, + more for garnish)","quantity":"1/2 cup","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"Monterey Jack (or Cheddar Cheese, shredded)","name":"Monterey Jack (or Cheddar Cheese, shredded)","quantity":"","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"avocado (diced)","name":"avocado (diced)","quantity":"","note":""},{"rawIngredient":"green onion (diced)","name":"green onion (diced)","quantity":"","note":""}],"preparationSteps":["In a blender or food processor combine the tomatillos, chipotle pepper, adobo sauce and chicken broth.  Pulse several times until pureed.

(You’re adding more cheese, so don’t over-do it.) Spread half the wilted kale over the cheese and sprinkle another sparse layer of cheese over the kale. Lay the second tortilla on top of the cheese. Use a large turner to press down on the quesadilla until the cheese starts to melt and sticks the tortillas together. Then turn the quesadilla and continue to cook until it’s nicely browned on both sides and the cheese is all melted. (I usually turn it a couple of times so I can see how both sides are browning.) Total cooking time for me was about 4 minutes, but it will depend on how hot your stove gets on medium. When the quesadilla is done, remove from the pan, use a long knife to cut it into fourths, and serve hot with the Sriracha-Ranch dipping sauce."],"photoIds":["6c4fade219554a3e887645b5cfc99ebe"],"adCampaignId":null,"photoUrls":[],"scaleFactor":null,"rating":null,"creationTimestamp":1560117010.367,"nutritionalInfo":null,"cookTime":300,"prepTime":600,"servings":"2 quesadillas","paprikaIdentifier":null},{"identifier":"90411d7840994e8a8644d06f9041d00c","timestamp":1595558577.1316872,"name":"Crunchy Seed & Oat Flatbread","icon":null,"note":"This bread is fantastic toasted.

Dough can be refrigerated for 3 days or frozen for 1 month.","Lightly butter a glass 9\" pie dish and set aside. After dough has chilled, let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes to slightly soften, then beat each disc of dough with a rolling pin to relax the gluten and soften the dough to make it easier to roll. Roll out one disc of dough onto a lightly floured surface (ie. marble slab) to a 13\" round, and about ¼\" thick. Transfer round of dough to prepared pie dish; roll it around your floured rolling pin and gently let dough relax into pie dish, lifting up edges to allow dough to slump into dish. Place back in fridge to chill while you roll out remaining dough to another 13\" round. Slide onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and chill while you prepare the filling.","For the Peach Filling: Bring a large pot of water to a simmer. Prepare a large bowl of ice water on the side. Score an X at the bottom of each peach, then carefully drop each into simmering water for 1-2 minutes. Remove and immediately drop into ice water. You can blanch multiple peaches at a time, about 3-4 or however many will fit into the pot. Repeat with remaining peaches. When peaches have cooled slightly, the skin should easily slip off when scraped with the back of a spoon.","Slice peeled peached into ½\" slices and place in large bowl. Add bourbon, lemon juice, granulated and brown sugars, flour, salt, nutmeg and all-spice. Toss well to combine. Let peaches marinate in the juices and spices for at least 30 minutes, up to 1 hour, then drain the juices. Sprinkle 1 Tablespoon each of flour and granulated sugar onto bottom of pie shell, as this will prevent a soggy bottom crust. Scrape filling into refrigerated pie shell. Place back into fridge while preheating oven.","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove 2nd disc of rolled dough from fridge and let sit at room temperature for 5 minutes to slightly soften and allow malleability to the bottom crust.","Brush egg wash along outer edge of bottom dough with half of the egg wash, then place remaining dough over filling and press edges together. Seal the dough to keep filling from leaking out of sides. I did not cut any excess dough off, and instead just wrapped it into the bottom crust and created a thick crust.

","Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water, stirring after about 1 minute to ensure they aren’t sticking to the bottom of the pot, and cook until they float to the surface for a few seconds and are tender-form, 4 to 5 minutes. ","Meanwhile, make the sauce: while the gnocchi are cooking, in a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. When the foam subsides, add the sage and cook until the sage is crispy and the butter is browned, about 3 minutes. ","Drain the gnocchi (don’t rinse it) and add it to the skillet. Toss to coat in the butter, add the Parm, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls and garnish with more Parm.

Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds (see #6 in Cake Baking Tips), then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. I recommend using nonstick spray for greasing.","Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.","Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed for 3 full minutes. The creamed butter and sugar will be extra creamy.

Avoid over-mixing as you don’t want to deflate the egg whites.","Pour/spoon batter evenly into cake pans.","Bake for around 27-31 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. After about 18 minutes, tent the cakes with aluminum foil to prevent the tops and sides from over-browning. To test the cakes for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it’s done. The cakes may look a little spongey on top as a result of the whipped egg whites. (That’s normal!)","Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.","With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder if frosting is too thin or another Tablespoon of cream/milk if frosting is too thick. Taste. Add more salt if needed. (I usually add another pinch.)","If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes. Discard or crumble over finished cake (or on ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer. (If desired, if the edges seem extra crumbly, apply a crumb coat which is a thin layer of frosting all over the cake. You can see I did this in the video tutorial above. Refrigerate the crumb coated cake for 15 minutes before adding the rest of the frosting.) Spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula and/or a bench scraper for the frosting. Garnish with sprinkles, if desired.","For extra neat slices, refrigerate cake for 30-60 minutes before slicing.

The crispy pancetta really adds to the flavor of the Swiss chard. And finishing it with a little balsamic vinegar gives it a bit of acidity making this a fantastic dish. I love sautéed greens. I always feel like I have eaten something healthy when I eat fresh sautéed greens. I volunteered to work in the garden at school today. What was supposed be an hour turned into two and half hours. I got a little carried away. The garden was fun; I can’t remember the last time I shoveled 5 wheel barrows full of anything. I was great exercise and I really was working hard. I was so hot and sweaty I had to jump in the pool to cool down. I was a little over heated and covered in dirt from head to toe. Over all it was an awesome day. Most of you know by now I have a small garden. It is very small in comparison to the school’s garden. My little garden is not nearly as much work. It was great fun and I had a great time seeing all the butterflies, bull frogs, birds, bumble bees, and lots of worms. The photography class stopped in while I was working, I pointed out the bull frog to a few girls. I hope they captured the moment. He was eating bugs. I wish I had my camera, I missed some great photos. The hard work was really satisfying. As a reward for all my effort and hard work, I picked some fresh Swiss Chard.
